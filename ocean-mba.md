# Ocean MBA

[My](https://www.nozdrenkov.com/about) notes from the [Ocean MBA](https://www.propellervc.com/oceanmba) workshop organised by [Propeller VC](https://www.propellervc.com/) at MIT.

### May 17 2023

- Brian Halligan (HubSpot CEO) -- Picking the Path to Becoming a Narwhal: The HubSpot Case Study
  - total addressable market (TAM)
  - lifetime value (LTV) -- how much revenue you can get from customer from the entire life
    - median Ollie pays us 5k (these are the arbitrary number to understand LTV).
    - `1k$ --> [Hubspot Ollie] --> 5K` -- `ROI 500%`
    - `5k$ --> [Hubspot Mary] --> 15k` -- `ROI 300%`
  - gross margin fees
  - sales commission price
  - customer retention, e.g.: `65% - 88%`
  - upsell, e.g.: `3% - 15%`
  - revenue retention, e.g.: `68% - 105%`
  - second pricing axes - subscriptions / contacts -- need to think how we're creating price, e.g. hectares covered by system, compute/storage used, etc.
  - PNL - profit and loss
  - SMB - small medium size business --> his MailChimp friend suggests Small & Enterprise exist only, no medium
  - inbound vs outbound marketing
  - "What are you right about that everyone else thinks you're wrong about" Peter Thiel
  - think about healthy disagreement -- e.g. you have two co-founders, if both disagree and one is strongly disagreed, but another is OK to stay on the rails, in that case they're doing the way of the strongly disagreed person. If both strongly disagree, then e.g. CEO decides. You need to come up with these rules in advance.

    Loss of biodiversity, "who gets f\*\*\*ed?"
- Brian Halligan | Strategy Lessons From The Grateful Dead
  - China Cat Sunflower - Live in Paris 1972 Version
    - jam band -- music style as mix of styles
  - Blue Ocean Strategy #book - not to outperform your competitors, but watch them -- good book about marketing
  - the strategy canvas
  - the innovator's dilemma #book -- more complex features, more profitable customers, as a result, they open the door for easier simpler products for less profitable customers
    - make a market
    - disrupt an existing market
  - find a **podcast** they listen to, get on that podcast and talk about your company
    - host an event, 55 stakeholders in the industry - in core market
- Subit Chakrabarti | Building Product: A Scientist's journey to creating and building products
  - Don't judge researchers by papers, even if they are in Nature. Github is better predictor. Or startups where they working.
  - My question: expectation to hedge your bets and publish papers while working at startup? Did you manage doing that?
    - Reply: managed to do! It was hard though, but good for raising money. Though prioritise github if you have to choose one :)
  - Tech debt is NOT your enemy - inefficiency, rabbit holes, bad planning
  - Your mission is your biggest unreasonable advantage. Use it wisely.
- Dharmesh Shah | How to Grow Better (and build one of the worldâ€™s best places to work)
  - Just like you attracting people with your product, same way you attract your team with your culture, so culture is a product, employees are customers of our product. What features they want? What bugs they found? Basically treat it like a product feedback session.
  - They published culture code. Transparency matters. E.g. you can filter out people, or Internet is very good at telling you why you're an idiot.
  - if you have a burning urge to create a company - you go do that, if you have a burning enterpreneurial drive, but you don't know your idea yet, come join us, it would be like a mini MBA, you can learn from it -- his recruiting pitch.
  - people value transparency - they know burn rate and everyone's salary, so they were also more careful to hire people, only people they trusted they hired
- Eddie Halfyard recommends:
  - ICCT, ICES for data
  - Gemini - Florida diving for fun and conservation
- Be careful with forecasting population dynamics data as an open platform, because fisheries could use it -- need to think about how to solve it (e.g. control access who you allow forecasting, don't forecast based on resent data, e.g. last half a year).
